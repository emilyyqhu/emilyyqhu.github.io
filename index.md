I am a microbial ecologist and bio-physical oceanographer. My current position as a C-CoMP Bridge-to-PhD Fellow has taken me to Brown University in Providence, RI, where I work in the Freilich group to understand how abiotic factors and ecological relationships influence microbial community assembly across the North Atlantic is with the Center for Chemical Currencies of a Microbial Planet. <br><br>


I completed my undergraduate degree in Chemistry at Rutgers University - New Brunswick, where I worked with [Jianyuan Zhang](https://zhang-lab.com/) performing chemical synthesis and functionalization of fullerene nanomaterials. <br>

Beyond my scientific interests, I am excited about writing, art-making, and reading fiction and creative non-fiction.
